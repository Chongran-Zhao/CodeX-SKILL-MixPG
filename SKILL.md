description: Prepare and run MixPERIGEE or MixPG viscoelasticity example builds and executions. Use this skill whenever the user wants to automate MixPG setup on their machine, verify `MixPERIGEE/conf/system_lib_loading.cmake`, recreate `~/build_MixPG`, run CMake for `examples/viscoelasticity_NURBS_TaylorHood`, compile with `make -j`, stage the `input/creep` files into the build directory, or edit `paras_preprocessor.yml`, `paras_preprocessor_init.yml`, `paras_driver.yml`, `LoadData.hpp`, and `MaterialModelData.hpp` for mesh, loading, time stepping, constitutive-model setup, MPI driver execution, and postprocessing.

# MixPG Case Runner

Use this skill as a task-friendly execution guide. Do not simulate a separate product-level task system inside the skill. Instead:

- keep progress updates short
- use simple stage labels
- make checkpoints explicit
- stop immediately on blocking failures
- never create git commits inside the source-file repository that is being edited or used for the scientific case setup
- do not collapse or hide any terminal commands or terminal outputs during reasoning or execution; show the exact commands and their outputs in full

## User Input Policy

When the user request leaves multiple selectable inputs unspecified, ask for them
once in a single consolidated question instead of asking them one by one.

The consolidated question should:

- group all missing selectable inputs in one message
- show the default value for each item when a safe default exists
- list all available options for categorical inputs
- let the user answer by accepting defaults or overriding only the items they care about
- use a clean table when the input list is long enough to benefit from structured display
- mark the default choice explicitly in the table
- state that quantities with units use SI units unless the user explicitly says otherwise
- avoid repeating follow-up clarification questions unless a later blocker is truly new

Use the consolidated question only for inputs that materially affect case setup,
for example:

- loading mode
- load direction and loaded face
- mesh resolution
- `cpu_size`
- `initial_time`
- `initial_step`
- `final_time`
- traction magnitude or displacement magnitude when the loading mode requires it
- constitutive model choice
- whether to reuse the current build directory or clean it
- which postprocess executables are enabled

Suggested style:

```md
请一次性确认这些输入；不改的项可直接用默认值。带单位的量默认按国际标准单位制（SI）解释。

| divV_calculator | allow / skip | skip | 默认不运行 |
```

Traction cases must explicitly confirm the traction magnitude. Do not invent a
traction value silently.

When presenting "keep current" choices, always resolve them to concrete current
values from the code or template first:

- for constitutive model, write the actual currently integrated model name
- for mesh, write the actual current template element counts such as `4 x 4 x 4`
- for postprocess executables, list each executable explicitly with allow/skip
  and mark its default
- for traction loading, allow the user to provide a traction expression, not
  only a scalar magnitude

Good progress labels:

- `Build Setup`
- `Input Setup`
- `Material And Load Setup`
- `Preprocess`
- `Driver`
- `Postprocess`

At each checkpoint, briefly report:

- what changed
- what command ran
- what files or outputs now exist
- what the next step is

## Core Defaults

Use these defaults unless the user overrides them:

- `cpu_size: 6`
- `initial_time: 0.0`
- `initial_step: 0.01`
- `final_time: 1.0`
- default constitutive model: keep the currently integrated model in `MaterialModelData.hpp`
- default build directory policy: clean existing `~/build_MixPG` before rebuild
- default postprocess enablement:
  `reanalysis_proj_driver = allow`,
  `prepostproc = allow`,
  `post_surface_force = allow`,
  `vis_3d_mixed = allow`,
  `divV_calculator = skip`

Compute postprocess step index with:

`time_end = (final_time - initial_time) / initial_step`

Example:

- `initial_time = 0.0`
- `initial_step = 0.01`
- `final_time = 1.0`
- therefore `time_end = 100`

If this is not an integer, stop and ask the user to reconcile `final_time` and `initial_step`.

## Execution Discipline

Keep execution conservative and reproducible.

### Single source of truth

Do not maintain the same case input in both the source example tree and the
build directory at the same time.

Default rule:

- edit the source example inputs and source files first
- then rebuild or restage into `~/build_MixPG`
- then run from the build directory

Only use build-directory-only hotfixes in an explicit debug or recovery mode,
and if you do:

- say clearly that the build copy has diverged from the source template
- list exactly which build-directory files were changed
- do not also change the corresponding source files in the same pass unless the
  user explicitly asks to reconcile them

### Single execution entrypoint

After input confirmation and file edits are done, prefer one controlled workflow
path instead of scattering manual stage runs.

Default rule:

- use the existing build-preparation script for build setup
- then run preprocess, driver, and postprocess in the documented order
- do not mix ad hoc extra commands into the middle of the workflow unless you
  explicitly label the session as manual debugging

### Preflight before execution

Before running any preprocess or MPI stage, validate the key operational inputs
first instead of discovering them by trial and error.

Required checks:

- `geo_file_base + "0.yml"` must resolve to a real file before preprocess
- `cpu_size` must be consistent across preprocess, driver, and MPI postprocess
- the chosen MPI launcher must match the MPI installation linked by the target
  executable
- for displacement cases, the requested load direction must be consistent across
  runtime YAML, init YAML, `mixed_ga_driver_displacement.cpp`, and
  `PNonlinear_Solver.cpp` before build or run starts

Do not "try several path variants" during normal execution. If the resolved
path is unsafe or ambiguous, stop and explain the blocker.

When old notes, template files, and current source behavior disagree, prefer
the current executable/source behavior over stale prose notes. Verify the real
behavior from the current example sources before turning it into an execution
rule.

### Build-script invocation rule

Do not rely on the executable bit of the build-preparation script.

Preferred form:

```bash
bash /Users/chongran/CodeX-SKILL-MixPG/scripts/prepare_visco_build.sh ...
```

### Warning vs fatal rule

Do not treat every noisy runtime message as a solver failure, but do not ignore
it either.

Classify outcomes as:

- `fatal`: nonzero exit code, missing required artifacts, missing executables,
  inconsistent inputs, or violated stage dependencies
- `warning`: the main stage exits with code `0` and produces the required
  outputs, but logs contain post-run cleanup warnings or similar non-blocking
  messages

If a warning occurs:

- report it explicitly
- keep it separate from scientific-result success or failure
- only continue if the required outputs for the next stage actually exist

## Build Setup

Check:

- `~/MixPERIGEE/conf/system_lib_loading.cmake`
- `~/MixPERIGEE/examples/viscoelasticity_NURBS_TaylorHood`
- `~/build_MixPG`

Build flow:

```bash
cmake ~/MixPERIGEE/examples/viscoelasticity_NURBS_TaylorHood -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j
cp -R ~/MixPERIGEE/examples/viscoelasticity_NURBS_TaylorHood/input/creep/. ~/build_MixPG/
```

Rules:

- if `~/build_MixPG` exists, do not silently clear it
- ask before destructive cleanup
- stop on CMake or compile errors
- warnings are allowed but should be summarized

## Input Setup

Files you may need to edit:

- `paras_preprocessor.yml`
- `paras_preprocessor_init.yml`
- `paras_driver.yml`
- `LoadData.hpp`
- `MaterialModelData.hpp`

### Geometry path rule

`geo_file_base` is sensitive and must be validated before preprocessing.

Rules:

- in the current `preprocess3d_main.cpp` and `preprocess3d_init.cpp`,
  `geo_file_base` is constructed by prefixing `HOME`
- therefore, for this current MixPG version, do not write a full
  `/Users/<name>/...` absolute path into the YAML when that would be prefixed by
  `HOME` again
- for geometry staged in `~/build_MixPG`, prefer a HOME-relative YAML value
  such as `/build_MixPG/patch`
- if the user gives a path that would become duplicated after HOME-prefix
  expansion, stop and explain the conflict instead of proceeding
- before running preprocessing, verify that `geo_file_base + "0.yml"` exists

Example:

- correct YAML base for current preprocess code: `/build_MixPG/patch`
- expected file: [`/Users/chongran/build_MixPG/patch0.yml`](/Users/chongran/build_MixPG/patch0.yml)

Do not generate broken paths like:

- `/Users/chongran/Users/chongran/build_MixPG/patch0.yml`

### Mesh rule

For single-patch cases:

- `num_inserted_x: [n]` means `n + 1` elements in x
- `num_inserted_y: [n]` means `n + 1` elements in y
- `num_inserted_z: [n]` means `n + 1` elements in z

### Boundary rule

- `Dirichlet_velo_x`, `Dirichlet_velo_y`, `Dirichlet_velo_z` define displacement constraints by direction and face
- `EBC` defines traction faces only

### Loading mode rule

Pick exactly one primary loading mode unless the user explicitly asks for coupling:

- traction
- displacement
- body force
- initial velocity

Keep unrelated loads at zero in `LoadData.hpp`.

### Traction rule

If traction loading:

- edit only `paras_preprocessor.yml`
- do not edit `paras_preprocessor_init.yml`
- put the loaded face in `EBC`
- encode the actual traction vector and time law in `surface_traction(...)`
- later run `preprocess3d` only

### Displacement rule

If displacement loading:

- edit `paras_preprocessor.yml`
- edit `paras_preprocessor_init.yml`
- edit `examples/viscoelasticity_NURBS_TaylorHood/mixed_ga_driver_displacement.cpp` if the loaded direction changes and the initialization basis still points to the old direction
- edit `examples/viscoelasticity_NURBS_TaylorHood/src/PNonlinear_Solver.cpp` if the loaded direction changes
- in `paras_preprocessor.yml`, keep the full runtime boundary setup
- in `paras_preprocessor_init.yml`, keep only the unique loaded direction-face entry
- encode the displacement time law in `disp_loading(...)`
- encode its derivative in `velo_loading(...)`
- keep displacement-driven loading smooth by default
- avoid abrupt jumps, kinks, or other discontinuities in displacement or velocity unless the user explicitly asks for them
- when choosing a default displacement history, prefer sinusoidal, smooth ramped, or other profiles with continuous velocity
- if the requested default case targets a large deformation, such as stretch
  ratio `>= 1.5`, keep the loading smooth but do not assume the current default
  `initial_step`, `final_time`, and material parameters will necessarily remain
  stable
- in `PNonlinear_Solver.cpp`, make sure the imposed basis vector matches the requested direction:
  use `base_x` for x displacement, `base_y` for y displacement, and `base_z` for z displacement
- in `mixed_ga_driver_displacement.cpp`, also make sure the prescribed initial
  velocity basis matches the requested direction:
  use `base_x` for x displacement, `base_y` for y displacement, and `base_z`
  for z displacement
- if the case is uniaxial displacement tension, constrain the other two directions on the loaded face to zero in `paras_preprocessor.yml`
- later run `preprocess3d` then `preprocess3d_init`

Example for bottom fixed, top z displacement:

`paras_preprocessor.yml`

```yml
Dirichlet_velo_x:
  0: [ 0, bot ]

Dirichlet_velo_y:
  0: [ 0, bot ]

Dirichlet_velo_z:
  0: [ 0, bot ]
  1: [ 0, top ]
```

`paras_preprocessor_init.yml`

```yml
Dirichlet_velo_x:

Dirichlet_velo_y:

Dirichlet_velo_z:
  0: [ 0, top ]
```

For uniaxial z-tension on the top face, the runtime file should also lock the other two directions on the top face:

```yml
Dirichlet_velo_x:
  0: [ 0, bot ]
  1: [ 0, top ]

Dirichlet_velo_y:
  0: [ 0, bot ]
  1: [ 0, top ]

Dirichlet_velo_z:
  0: [ 0, bot ]
  1: [ 0, top ]
```

## Material And Load Setup

Use:

- `examples/viscoelasticity_NURBS_TaylorHood/include/MaterialModelData.hpp`
- `examples/viscoelasticity_NURBS_TaylorHood/include/LoadData.hpp`

Material rule:

- if the user only names a model, search `~/MixPERIGEE/include`
- choose the closest compatible model already supported by the current factory structure
- preserve current parameter scale unless the user asks otherwise
- report the defaults you assumed

Load rule:

- traction case: make `surface_traction(...)` nonzero and keep other load modes zero
- displacement case: make `disp_loading(...)` and `velo_loading(...)` nonzero and keep other load modes zero
- body-force case: make `body_force(...)` nonzero and keep other load modes zero

Consistency checks:

- displacement-loaded face must not also appear in `EBC`
- traction-loaded face must be declared in `EBC`
- requested displacement direction must match the edited `Dirichlet_velo_*` block
- requested displacement direction must also match the initialization basis used in `mixed_ga_driver_displacement.cpp`
- requested displacement direction must also match the `base_*` vector used in `PNonlinear_Solver.cpp`
- for uniaxial displacement tension, the loaded face must also be constrained to zero in the other two directions
- requested load duration must match the time law and `paras_driver.yml`
- if any of those direction checks disagree, treat it as a preflight blocker and
  do not proceed to build, preprocess, or driver

## Driver Time Setup

Use `paras_driver.yml` to control physical time:

- `initial_time`
- `initial_step`
- `final_time`

Default if unspecified:

```yml
initial_time: 0.0
initial_step: 0.01
final_time: 1.0
```

Do not accidentally keep sample defaults such as `0.1` and `200.0`.

Check:

- `initial_step > 0`
- `initial_time <= final_time`
- computed `time_end` is integral

## Preprocess

Use the same `cpu_size` everywhere. Default is `6`.

Rules:

- if traction loading:
  run `./preprocess3d`
- if displacement loading:
  run `./preprocess3d`
  then run `./preprocess3d_init`

Before running, make sure:

- `geo_file_base` resolves to a valid file base on the current machine
- `cpu_size` in the preprocessor file matches the intended MPI size

## Driver

Choose the executable by loading type:

- non-displacement-driven case: `./mixed_ga_driver`
- displacement-driven case: `./mixed_ga_driver_displacement`

Run with:

```bash
<matched_mpi_launcher> -np <cpu_size> <driver_executable> | tee driver_log.txt
```

Rules:

- `-np` must match preprocessor `cpu_size`
- default `cpu_size` is `6`
- always save output to `driver_log.txt`
- do not use whichever `mpirun` or `mpiexec` appears first in `PATH`
- use an explicitly chosen launcher that matches the MPI installation linked by
  the driver executable

## Postprocess

Use the actual built names:

- `./reanalysis_proj_driver`
- `./prepostproc`
- `./vis_3d_mixed`
- `./post_surface_force`
- `./divV_calculator`

Standard order:

1. `<matched_mpi_launcher> -np <cpu_size> ./reanalysis_proj_driver -time_end <time_end>`
2. `./prepostproc`
3. `<matched_mpi_launcher> -np <cpu_size> ./post_surface_force`
4. whichever downstream tool the user wants, for example:
   `<matched_mpi_launcher> -np <cpu_size> ./vis_3d_mixed -time_end <time_end>`

Default enablement when the user does not override it:

- `reanalysis_proj_driver`: allow
- `prepostproc`: allow
- `post_surface_force`: allow
- `vis_3d_mixed`: allow
- `divV_calculator`: skip

Rules:

- the driver and all postprocess executables have strict data dependencies and must be run serially
- do not start `reanalysis_proj_driver`, `post_surface_force`, `prepostproc`, or `vis_3d_mixed` before the driver has finished successfully
- do not run postprocess executables in parallel with each other
- do not launch `post_surface_force` and `vis_3d_mixed` in the same command batch or parallel tool call
- `reanalysis_proj_driver` must use the same MPI size as preprocessing and driver
- before running `reanalysis_proj_driver`, determine the required `vis_m` from the finished material model or the number of relaxation branches, and make that value match the downstream ISV readers
- `post_surface_force` and `vis_3d_mixed` depend on files such as `postpart_p*.h5`, which are generated by `prepostproc`
- do not run `post_surface_force` or `vis_3d_mixed` before `prepostproc` has finished and produced the required dependency artifacts
- `post_surface_force` should be run before `vis_3d_mixed`
- do not say that `vis_3d_mixed` has been run unless its command was actually executed and finished successfully
- use `prepostproc`, not the old `prepost` name
- `-time_end` is a step index, not physical time
- `simulation_running_note.txt` may be stale about exact executable names or
  command forms; when it conflicts with the built executable names or working
  command sequence, trust the built executable reality
- before running `vis_3d_mixed`, update `paras_pos_vis.yml` so `time_start`, `time_step`, and `time_end` match the finished run
- if `paras_pos_vis.yml.time_end` exceeds the highest available `SOL_*.pvtu` index from the current run, treat visualization as not ready and fail clearly instead of attempting `vis_3d_mixed`
- if `post_surface_force` or `vis_3d_mixed` is enabled, update the corresponding inputs before execution instead of assuming the template is already correct
- if `post_surface_force` or `vis_3d_mixed` is enabled, synchronize their processed time-step range with the finished run
- if `vis_3d_mixed` is enabled, check that its material-model-related settings and the expected number of internal variables are consistent with the finished run before treating visualization as safe
- before running `reanalysis_proj_driver`, derive `vis_m` from the current
  constitutive model and pass it explicitly; do not rely on the current source
  default `-vis_m 1` when the model has multiple relaxation/internal-variable
  groups

### Surface-force postprocess rule

If `post_surface_force` is requested or part of the default postprocess chain:

- edit `examples/viscoelasticity_NURBS_TaylorHood/post_surface_traction.cpp`
- update `target_surface_list.emplace_back(...)` so the selected patch id and face match the current loading boundary condition
- if the case uses multiple loaded faces or patches, add one entry per target surface
- update the output record so the reported displacement and force components match the loaded direction
- synchronize the post-surface-force time range with the finished run so it processes the full intended index range, for example `time_end = 100` for `1.0 / 0.01`

For simple single-direction loading, keep the surface-force output minimal:

- only the loaded face needs to be processed
- only the loaded direction needs to be reported as displacement and traction
- do not require unrelated direction components unless the user explicitly asks for them

Direction mapping for the output record:

- x loading: write `sum_dispx/sum_area` and `sum_Fx/sum_area`
- y loading: write `sum_dispy/sum_area` and `sum_Fy/sum_area`
- z loading: write `sum_dispz/sum_area` and `sum_Fz/sum_area`

Consistency checks:

- the target face in `post_surface_traction.cpp` must match the traction or displacement loading face
- the recorded component in `Force_disp_record.txt` must match the requested loading direction
- for simple single-direction loading, it is sufficient to validate only the loaded face and the loaded direction component
- the time range used by `post_surface_force` must match the computed run range instead of stopping at the example default
- after `post_surface_force`, inspect `Force_disp_record.txt` and fail clearly if the traction or force column contains `nan`, `inf`, or another obviously invalid value
- do not treat a completed `post_surface_force` command as a good scientific result unless `Force_disp_record.txt` passes the validity check

### Visualization postprocess rule

If `vis_3d_mixed` is requested or part of the default postprocess chain:

- update `paras_pos_vis.yml`
- make `time_start`, `time_step`, and `time_end` match the finished run
- make sure the visualization input is consistent with the finished material model
- make sure the expected number of internal variables matches the finished run

Consistency checks:

- `paras_pos_vis.yml.time_end` must not exceed the highest available `SOL_*.pvtu` index
- the visualization time range must match the finished run instead of an example template
- the template `paras_pos_vis.yml` may carry a very large placeholder
  `time_end`; never assume it is already safe for the current run
- the material-model-related visualization settings must match the actual solved case
- the expected internal-variable count must match the generated outputs for the solved case

## Reporting

After the requested run and postprocess stages finish successfully, create a
report package under:

- `~/build_MixPG/report`

Required outputs:

- a scientific-quality figure generated from the post-surface-force
  time-displacement-traction record
- at least one visualization figure exported from the completed
  `vis_3d_mixed` workflow when visualization is enabled
- a report document in Markdown
- a PDF converted from that Markdown report

Default reporting rule:

- create `~/build_MixPG/report` if it does not exist
- place the generated figures in that directory
- prefer calling the shared report-rendering script instead of improvising the whole report flow in-chat:
  `python3 /Users/chongran/CodeX-SKILL-MixPG/scripts/render_mixpg_report.py ...`
- reuse a stable report template whenever possible instead of drafting the whole report from scratch
- write the report in Markdown first
- then convert the Markdown report to PDF
- only fill in case-specific values, figures, and short interpretation text for the current run
- do not generate or present a final report as complete if the driver diverged,
  even when partial `SOL_*` outputs exist

### Surface-force figure rule

If `post_surface_force` is enabled and produces a time-displacement-force or
time-displacement-traction record, plot it in a scientific style instead of
leaving it as raw text only.

For simple single-direction loading:

- the plot only needs the loaded-direction displacement and the matching
  loaded-direction traction or force quantity
- do not clutter the figure with unrelated components unless the user asked for
  them

Plot expectations:

- use clear axis labels with units
- use a clean white background and readable font sizes
- include a concise title or caption identifying the case and loaded direction
- save the figure into `~/build_MixPG/report`

### Visualization figure rule

If `vis_3d_mixed` is enabled, do not stop at raw visualization files alone.

Required reporting behavior:

- export at least one representative visualization image for the current run
- place that image in `~/build_MixPG/report`
- include it in the final report
- if the image is produced by a local plotting script from `vis_3d_mixed` output files, describe it accurately as a generated visualization figure
- only call it a ParaView preview or ParaView screenshot when it actually comes from a ParaView render or screenshot workflow

### Report content rule

The final report should be concise but publication-oriented.

Minimum contents:

- case summary
- geometry and mesh summary
- constitutive model summary
- loading summary
- solver and time-step summary
- one force- or traction-related figure from `post_surface_force`
- one visualization figure
- a short result interpretation in plain language

Template rule:

- keep a reusable report skeleton with fixed section order and style
- do not spend tokens regenerating unchanged boilerplate on every run
- update only the case metadata, quantitative summaries, figure references, and short interpretation for the current case

### Reporting guardrails

- do not claim the report is complete unless the Markdown file, PDF file, and
  required images all exist in `~/build_MixPG/report`
- do not claim a visualization figure exists unless `vis_3d_mixed` actually ran
  successfully and the image was exported
- if the surface-force record exists but no figure was generated from it, treat
  the reporting stage as incomplete

## Failure Policy

Stop immediately and explain the issue if you see any of these:

- bad geometry path expansion
- non-integral `time_end`
- inconsistent `cpu_size`
- compile errors
- load setup contradicts YAML boundary setup
- requested driver executable does not match loading type
